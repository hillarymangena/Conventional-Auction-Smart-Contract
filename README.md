# Conventional-Auction-Smart-Contract
Smart contract for the Ethereum Blockchain. Programming and testing is done on the Remix IDE using Solidity 0.4.17. Incremental Programming is heavily utilised.

This project combines and uses most of the attributes that have seen blockchain technology gain traction in recent times. In this
instance, the ethereum blockchain is used to create a smart contract for conventional bidding with limited bidders. The idea is
to have bidders place tickets for the items they want to bid for, without the possibility of making alterations once the bid has been placed.
Program is robust and runs smoothly on the testnet.
